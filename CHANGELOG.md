# SlowCup — changelog

(Formerly "Steep" — user-facing brand renamed in v3.59; internal file/function names, the
`steep-tea-log` repo/cache prefix, and historical entries below keep the old name.)

Newest first. "Deploy" = files to push to GitHub Pages. SQL = run once in the Supabase SQL editor.

## Module map (after the v3 split)
`app.js` was split into feature modules loaded in order by `index.html`. They share one
global scope (plain scripts, not ES modules), so cross-file function calls just work.
Concatenating them in this order reproduces the old `app.js` byte-for-byte.

1. `steep-core.js` — constants, `state`, settings/persist helpers, small utils, stars,
   image upload, the pixel logo, `render()`, header, `goView`, `bindDynamic`.
2. `steep-settings.js` — backup/export/import, settings modal, `setSetting`.
3. `steep-dashboard.js` — `computeStats`, persona, brewing clock, achievements
   (compute/badge/sync/confetti), heatmap, streak card, recap, onboarding,
   achievements page, `viewDashboard`.
4. `steep-teas.js` — tea cards, vendor list, sort/filter, `viewTeas` (Teas|Vessels segments), tea form, tea detail.
5. `steep-social.js` — friends/feed/profile/follow.
6b. `steep-passport.js` — world dot-map, origin→country matching, tea click-through.
6. `steep-sessions.js` — sessions calendar, vessels, session-edit modal, session flow
   (setup/steeping/finish/quick), timer, tags, `commitSession`.
7. `steep-boot.js` — `SteepDB.boot(init)` + service-worker registration (loads last).

Data layer stays in `steep-data.js`; Supabase keys in `supabase-config.js`.

---
## v3.69 — the update banner now says what changed
Deploy: `steep-core.js` (APP_VERSION + new `WHATS_NEW` const), `steep-boot.js` (banner render), `service-worker.js` (v79). No SQL.
Third of the cleanup tail (ROADMAP-v4 Pillar F) — a small rider.
- The v3.27 "new version" banner showed only "A new version of SlowCup is ready." — no hint of what the update contained.
- Adds a `WHATS_NEW` constant beside `APP_VERSION` (one human sentence), rendered as a second quiet line under the headline in `showUpdateBanner` (steep-boot.js). One line — no changelog list, no link-out. A `typeof` guard keeps the banner valid if a client is still on a stale cached `steep-core.js` without the const.
- This deploy's copy is self-referential: "Updates now tell you what changed — like this." — it demonstrates the feature it announces.
- Deploy ritual: `WHATS_NEW` now joins the version bumps (new step 2c in CLAUDE.md) — bump it each deploy alongside `CACHE_NAME` and `APP_VERSION`.

## v3.68 — in-session brew guide: reversible "hide", not a lossy "turn off" (issue #1)
Deploy: `steep-sessions.js`, `steep-core.js` (APP_VERSION), `service-worker.js` (v78). No SQL.
Second of the cleanup tail (ROADMAP-v4 Pillar F). Fixes the reported "in-session turn off link gives
weird feedback."
- **The bug:** mid-steeping, the schedule strip's "turn off" link called `d_setBrewMode('off')`, which
  reset `timeShift` to 0 (silently discarding the user's accumulated "+Xs vs guide" nudge) and set
  `brewMode='off'` — but `d.schedule` was never nulled, so the card stayed on screen. You tapped
  "turn off," nothing turned off, and your nudge quietly vanished.
- **The fix:** the link is now **"hide"** (`d_hideStrip()`), a purely visual, reversible collapse.
  It leaves `brewMode`, `d.schedule`, and `timeShift` untouched and sets `d.scheduleHidden=true`;
  `scheduleStripHTML` renders a one-line "Brew guide · hidden · show" ghost row (`d_showStrip()`
  restores it). The "How was that pour?" nudge row hides with it and returns intact — the carried
  `timeShift` survives the round-trip. `scheduleHidden` resets to false at `beginSteeping`.
- The setup preview's **Off** segment (`d_setBrewMode('off')`) is unchanged — that's a legitimate
  pre-steeping choice; only the in-session link changed.
- `node --check` clean; browser-verified both themes (hide → ghost row → show restores strip + nudge
  with the same `+Xs` carry).
- **Issue #1 is fixed** — close it with a comment linking this entry (needs auth; Niklas via web UI).

## v3.67 — greeting v3, session-aware (issue #2)
Deploy: `steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-core.js` (APP_VERSION), `service-worker.js` (v77). No SQL.
First of the renumbered cleanup tail (ROADMAP-v4 Pillar F).
- **The card now reacts to a session logged in the current bucket** instead of nudging another
  same-bucket brew (the reported bug: "I logged the predicted tea and it suggested another green").
  `greetingCardHTML` gains a session-aware branch (steep-dashboard.js): if there's a session in the
  current time-of-day bucket today, it **acknowledges** the ritual, then either **suggests forward**
  for a later active window or lets the card **rest** — never a third-cup nudge.
- **Predicted-vs-actual acknowledgment** — the day's pick is recomputable (same seed), so the card
  knows what it suggested. Took the predicted tea → "Good choice — the {name} it is." register; took
  something else → warm surprise, never correction: "The {name} instead — didn't see that coming."
  Small pools each via `d_copyPick` (now takes a `salt` so the ack + tail draw independently yet stay
  one-voice-per-day). It never scores the prediction ("I was right/wrong" is out).
- **Same-day type-variety guard** (`VARIETY_GUARD_SAME_DAY`, on) — a forward suggestion for later
  *today* won't repeat the just-logged type ("not two greens in a row in the morning"). Implemented as
  a scoring exclusion in the new shared `d_scorePick(target, todayKey, excludeIds, excludeType)`; if
  every candidate shares the type, the card **rests** rather than break the rule loudly.
- The no-session branch (v3.55 window-aware redirect + v3.61 copy pools) is unchanged; the greeting h2
  stays truthful to now; brewed-today is still excluded in other buckets (normal branch).
- Validated `fixtures/greeting-test.js` (local, now 44): predicted-taken vs surprise copy, forward
  vs rest, the variety guard + all-same-type fallback, cross-bucket brewed-today exclusion, and
  determinism; normal/redirect sweeps moved to a sessionless mocked day so they exercise the intended
  branch. Browser-verified both themes (jade-pale card, jade links, warm copy; no console errors).
- **Issue #2 is fixed** — close it with a comment linking this entry (needs auth; Niklas via web UI).

## docs — reconcile v4 roadmap into the repo
Deploy: **new** `ROADMAP-v4.md`, `ROADMAP-v3-next.md` (superseded banner), `CLAUDE.md` (doc pointers).
No app change, no SQL, no cache/APP_VERSION bump.
- **`ROADMAP-v4.md`** is now the active forward roadmap ("ready for strangers", signed off 2026-07-10) —
  reconciled from the claude.ai strawman + `TASK-issues-triage-addendum.md`. Pillars A–F: brew-advice
  phase 2 (+ the new `japanese`/senchadō method), launch infra, first-run experience, design round 2 (+
  flavor experience), the smarter-over-time backlog, and the **cleanup tail with all 5 issues triaged**.
  Pillar F carries the sequenced tail: v3.66 ✓ · **v3.67** greeting v3 session-aware (issue #2, extended:
  predicted-vs-actual + same-day type-variety guard) · **v3.68** in-session turn-off (issue #1) · **v3.69**
  what's-new banner · **v3.70** greeting v4 habit-aware (issues #4+#5; zero-session line decided guilt-free/
  playful). Issue #3 = workflow question, close-now-no-build (needs auth — Niklas via web UI or a token).
- `ROADMAP-v3-next.md` keeps the Shipped log, frozen/parked specs, and the launch checklist; CLAUDE.md's
  doc list now points at v4 first.

## v3.66 — feed pagination + social error becomes an inline notice
Deploy: `steep-data.js`, `steep-social.js`, `steep-core.js` (socialErr + APP_VERSION + state), `styles.css`,
`service-worker.js` (v76). No SQL. Resumes the SlowCup batch tail after the design rework.
- **Feed pagination** (`getFeed(limit=50, offset=0)`, steep-data.js) — switched `.limit()` → `.range(offset,
  offset+limit-1)` with a secondary `.order('id')` so a `session_date` tie can't reshuffle rows across a page
  boundary. Returns `hasMore` (page came back full). `loadMoreFeed()` (steep-social.js) fetches the next page
  and **appends**, de-duping by session id so a row that shifted across the boundary (a session inserted up
  top between fetches) can't render twice. Manual, quiet **"Load more"** ghost button under the feed — no
  infinite scroll; hidden when `hasMore` is false. Page size stays the old cap (50). Personal-stats scoping
  (`loadKey` `user_id` filter) is untouched — the feed still uses `getFeed()` separately.
- **`socialErr` → sticky inline notice** (steep-core.js) — the last `alert()` in the app is gone. The same
  message branches (missing tables / RLS policy / offline / generic) now set `state.social.err` and render a
  dismissible `.social-notice` at the top of the Friends view (red hairline border, porcelain-dim, themes in
  both). These are multi-sentence setup diagnostics, so a toast would be wrong. Cleared on the next
  follow/unfollow attempt or via the × (`dismissSocialErr`). Falls back to a long toast if `state` isn't ready.
- Browser-verified (both themes): the notice renders + themes + dismisses, RLS/missing-table branches pick
  the right copy, "Load more" shows only when `hasMore` and wires `loadMoreFeed`, de-dupe append holds. No
  console errors (the `[Steep] follow failed` lines were the test harness exercising `socialErr`). `node
  --check` clean on all touched files.

## docs — DESIGN.md refreshed to post-round-1 reality
Deploy: `DESIGN.md` only. No app change, no SQL, no cache/APP_VERSION bump. Prep for design round 2.
- Version stamp → v3.65; noted design round 1 complete (WS3 language · WS1 Wrapped · WS4 landing · WS2 Insights).
- Retired the last **Fraunces** reference (the loaded-weights line → Shippori Mincho 500/600/700/800).
- **Emoji-ban** made explicit, with the one known leftover recorded: the 🧘 on the steeping Focus-mode
  button (`steep-sessions.js`) — slated for a hairline replacement, not yet swept.
- **Accent placement rules as shipped** — leaf (favourite + "most reached-for" note), hanko (Wrapped "to
  keep" + Insights "highest note"), ensō (timer/focus ring + faint hero backdrop on Wrapped cover & landing
  hero), seigaiha (reserved: empty states, Wrapped closing card, landing CTA wash).
- **Current surfaces** updated: Insights is the reflective room (observation register, guarded by the
  fixture); Wrapped is the swipeable seasonal sequence; added `landing.html` as an off-app surface.

## v3.65 — WS2 Insights overhaul (the reflective room)
Deploy: `styles.css`, `steep-insights.js`, `steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-core.js` (APP_VERSION),
`service-worker.js` (v75). No SQL. Last of four design workstreams (WS3 → WS1 → WS4 → **WS2**) — the
design rework is complete.
- **Insights is now a curated reflective room**, not a flat stack of same-weight cards. `viewInsights()`
  leads with the hero and drops its old page title. The five old insights cards (recap, insights, types,
  most-brewed/top-rated) are replaced by six ordered sections built in `dashCardsInsights` and rendered
  through the existing dashLayout registry (so Home stays editable and cross-tab moves still work). Since
  `renderDashboard` concatenates each card's own HTML, the run composes into one room:
  - **Hero observation** (jade-pale card, the ONE thing) — mono eyebrow that widens honestly by window
    ("This week, mostly" → "Lately, mostly" → "Mostly" as data thins), a Shippori observation
    ("Green, and mornings."), a 12-bar time-of-day rhythm (the brewing clock, folded in), and one
    supporting line ("9 of your 9 steeps came in the morning.").
  - **Cadence reading** — a Shippori sentence over an 8-week sessions sparkline (jade, no axes).
  - **Type mix** — one slim stacked bar in the fixed `.dot-*` type colors + a mono legend.
  - **Steep shape** — an ascending amber polyline of average steep duration by index + a ledger caption
    ("35s · 45s · 58s").
  - **Two quiet notes** (not a leaderboard) — leaf = most reached-for, hanko = highest note.
  - **Wrapped teaser** — a quiet deep-jade strip into the WS1 season sequence.
  Sections are separated by **hairline top-borders**, not boxed cards. New `.ins-*` classes in styles.css.
- **Register: observations, not KPIs** — every headline is a sentence; the old "This month vs last ↑ 14
  vs 12" arrow row is gone. No up/down arrows, no vs-last-week %, no targets anywhere in the room.
- **Retired:** the recap stats grid + week/month/all-time toggle (superseded by the hero + reading; the
  Home totals card still carries the raw all-time numbers). `recapHTML`/`computeRecap`/`periodRange`/
  `setRecapPeriod`/`insightsHTML`/`wrappedTeaser` removed. Saved dashLayouts self-heal — old insights
  card ids drop out via the existing unknown-id filter, new ids append.
- Validated `fixtures/insights-room-test.js` (committed, data-free, 33): the brand guardrail (no arrow/%/
  vs in the hero + four viz observations), graceful degradation (each section drops to '' when its data
  is missing), and structure (hero top-type + time-of-day, type widths sum ~100%, ascending steep caption,
  leaf+hanko notes). Browser-verified BOTH themes (computed styles + screenshots): hero jade-pale/ink,
  jade bars, hairline borders, fixed type colors, amber steep line, deep-jade teaser with light text in
  dark; no console errors; no horizontal scroll.

## WS4 — slowcup.app landing page (static; NOT part of the PWA)
Deploy: **new** `landing.html` + `landing-assets/{app-home,app-tea-detail,app-sessions}.png`. No SQL.
**No `CACHE_NAME` / `APP_VERSION` bump and no `FILES_TO_CACHE` change on purpose** — this touches zero
PWA files, so invalidating every tester's app cache for a page the app never loads would be wrong. Third
of four design workstreams (WS3 → WS1 → **WS4** → WS2).
- **New standalone marketing page** (`landing.html`) — a single self-contained static file: inline
  `<style>` + inline `<svg><defs>` sprite (logo · fav-leaf · ensō · i-share-hl · seigaiha), Google Fonts
  link (Shippori Mincho / Inter / IBM Plex Mono), **no JS, no cookies, no analytics**. Theme follows the OS
  via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` overriding the `:root` token set (the prototype's JS light/dark
  toggle was dropped per the handoff). All CTAs are `mailto:slowcupapp@gmail.com?subject=SlowCup%20invite%20request`.
- **Sections** (single column, centered, text capped ~720px): nav (pixel logo + "request an invite") ·
  hero ("A TEA LOG FOR THE RITUAL" eyebrow → Shippori "The calm tea log." at `clamp(44px,11vw,64px)` with
  a ~10% amber ensō behind → promise subline → jade **Request an invite** → "private beta" micro) · three
  dark-bezel device screenshots (middle raised 24px, zeroed when they stack) · three philosophy beats
  (leaf/ensō/share-icon chips) · jade-deep CTA panel with faint seigaiha + amber button + mono email ·
  footer ("a static page · no cookies, no tracking, nothing to accept").
- **Screenshots are placeholders from the handoff bundle** (`landing-assets/`, flagged in an HTML comment):
  they predate WS3/WS1 and `app-tea-detail.png` still shows the old **"Steep"** wordmark (pre-v3.59). They
  MUST be reshot on the current build before slowcup.app points here.
- **Staging note:** placed as `landing.html` at the repo root (reachable at
  `tosinik.github.io/steep-tea-log/landing.html`) — not linked from the app. The root/`index.html` split for
  the actual slowcup.app domain is part of the deferred domain migration.
- Browser-verified both themes (light via CSSOM tokens, dark visually), desktop + mobile 375px (single
  column, devices wrap, h1 clamps to 44px, **no horizontal scroll**), all three screenshots load, no console
  errors.

## v3.64 — WS1 SlowCup Wrapped (swipeable story cards)
Deploy: `styles.css`, `steep-insights.js`, `steep-core.js` (APP_VERSION + carousel wiring),
`service-worker.js` (v74). No SQL. Second of four design workstreams (WS3 → **WS1** → WS4 → WS2).
- **Wrapped is now a horizontal scroll-snap sequence of full-width story cards** (was a single static
  card). `viewWrapped()` (steep-insights.js) builds up to 8 cards — cover · sessions · time at the
  table · companion · rhythm · new this season · standout · kept/share — as `.wrap-card` panels in a
  `.wrap-track` (`overflow-x:auto; scroll-snap-type:x mandatory`; each card `flex:0 0 100%;
  scroll-snap-align:center`). **Seasonal wash**: cards alternate jade-deep / amber fields with
  porcelain breathers, driven by dedicated `--wc-*` tokens in both theme blocks (dark fields never go
  full-bright). **Catalogue numbering** (№ 00…) + a **hanko-sealed** standout plate; the cover carries
  a faint ensō, the closing card a seigaiha wash. Reuses the WS3 sprite (`#fav-leaf`, `#enso`,
  `#hanko`, `#seigaiha`).
- **Graceful degradation** — `wrappedKinds()` drops any card whose stat is missing (no timing → the
  time card falls back to cold-brew count, then drops if neither; no top type / no discoveries / no
  rating each drop their card) and the numbering **re-flows** so a one-tea, few-session season still
  reads as a contiguous run. Cover · sessions · kept are always present.
- **Only JS besides share**: dot indicators track the scroll position (`bindDynamic()` in steep-core:
  `Math.round(scrollLeft/clientWidth)` → active dot, rAF-throttled) and are tappable (`wrapGo(i)`,
  respects `prefers-reduced-motion`). Kept the **share-as-text** action (`shareWrapped` unchanged path)
  — `wrappedShareText` reworded to the agreed format (`SlowCup Wrapped · Summer 2026 / 14 sessions ·
  43 infusions · 12 teas (5 new) / Companion: … ×6 / Standout: … ★4.5 / Quietly, that's a season.`).
  Kept the **empty state** ("Your {season} is just beginning") and the **"SlowCup Wrapped"** name.
- No inline styles added beyond the one data-driven bar height (matches the existing `.typebar-fill`
  pattern); everything else is `.wrap-*` classes in `styles.css`.
- Validated `fixtures/wrapped-cards-test.js` (committed, data-free, 22 assertions): degrade drops the
  right cards, catalogue numbering re-flows with no gaps, footer denominator = surviving count,
  cold-brew fallback fires, discoveries overflow (+N), standout escapes + seals with the hanko, share
  text format. Browser-verified both themes via injected `computeWrapped()` sample (screenshots
  time out on the auth gate): 8 cards / 8 dots, fields + fonts + accents resolve per theme, active dot
  stays amber (`--wc-enso`) in dark, dot-tracking math 0→0/3→3/7→7, degraded season → 4 contiguous
  cards, no console errors.

## v3.63 — WS3 design language (Shippori Mincho · hairline icons · accent vocabulary)
Deploy: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `steep-core.js`, `steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-insights.js`,
`steep-passport.js`, `steep-sessions.js`, `steep-shopping.js`, `steep-social.js`, `steep-teas.js`,
`steep-data.js`, `service-worker.js` (v73). No SQL. First of four design workstreams (WS3 → WS1 → WS4 → WS2).
- **Display font → Shippori Mincho** (replaces Fraunces). New `--font-display` token in both theme
  blocks; `h1,h2,h3,.display` render at weight 700; the wordmark bumped to 700. All inline
  `'Fraunces',serif` across the JS views swept to `var(--font-display)` (zero Fraunces refs remain).
  Google-Fonts `<link>` swapped (`Shippori+Mincho:wght@500;600;700;800`). Inter/IBM Plex Mono unchanged.
- **Header emoji → hairline stroke icons.** A hidden `<svg><defs>` sprite in `index.html` (sibling of
  `#app`, survives re-renders) holds `i-{friends,shopping,world,achievements,settings,share,edit,camera}-hl`
  + accent marks. New `icon(id,px,cls)` helper (steep-core) emits `<use>`d SVGs; topbar 👥🛒🌍🏆⚙ and the
  "Edit layout" pencil now use it. Header-icon symbols omit `stroke-width` so `.hl` sets it via inherited
  CSS — **1.7 light / 1.9 dark** so thin strokes don't go faint; `.icon-btn.active svg` goes `--white`.
- **Favourite mark → tea leaf** (`favLeaf()`, `.i-fav` jade). Replaces ♥/★ on tea cards, running-low
  rows, the tea-detail pill (now jade-family), the favourites filter chip, and shopping-list rows.
- **Ensō ring on the steep timer.** `.timer-display` is now wrapped in a `.timer-ring` with an inline
  ensō `<path id="ensoArc">`; the arc fills via `stroke-dashoffset` (`pathLength=100`, offset
  `100*(1-focusProgress)`) updated each tick in `updateTimerDisplayOnly`, smooth `.9s` transition
  (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`). New `--enso` token: amber-bright `#E3A15C` on the light-theme
  dark box, dark-jade `#2A4130` on the dark-theme light-green box.
- **Hanko + seigaiha** defs added to the sprite (used by WS1/WS2); hanko fill is `var(--red)` so it
  themes (fixed-red in the prototype). Pixel-teapot logo (`steepLogoSVG`) unchanged — it stays the brand.
- Verified in-browser (both themes): Shippori loads + applies at weight 700; all sprite symbols resolve
  and `<use>` icons paint; ensō dashoffset = 50 at 50% progress; `--enso` resolves per theme; no console
  errors. `node --check` clean on all touched files.

## v3.62 — freshness cues + sparkline rider + night-copy patch
Deploy: `steep-teas.js`, `steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-core.js` (APP_VERSION), `service-worker.js` (v72). No SQL.
- **Freshness cues** (steep-teas.js) — one soft, italic, observational line under the Harvest field on
  tea detail. **Not on Home, not in the picker, no badge/alarm.** Requires a VALID year (1980..now+1;
  rejects "-", blank, out-of-range) to reason about age — season is optional decoration. Direction by
  style: fresh greens (+ shincha/sencha/gyokuro/first-flush/longjing keywords) → "…is at its best
  young"; whites & pu-erh (+ sheng/aged keywords) → "this style deepens with age"; every other style
  stays silent. On the real export exactly two fire — "Spring 2026 harvest — shincha is at its best
  young." and "2021 harvest — this style deepens with age." No raw user text is rendered (numeric
  year, whitelisted season + style word).
- **Sparkline rider** (steep-teas.js) — where `inventorySparkline` draws nothing *only* because a tea
  has no `purchaseDate` (but has a bought amount), a quiet "Add a purchase date to see the stock
  curve" link to Edit. Silent when a date exists or there's no bought amount.
- **Night-copy patch** (steep-dashboard.js) — the active-with-history line "How do you feel about the
  {name} this {bucket}?" now uses the BUCKET_WHEN form, so a night-active user reads "…tonight?"
  instead of the clunky "…this late-night?" (Niklas-approved to ride here).
- Validated: `fixtures/freshness-test.js` (local, 11) — exactly the two live cues with exact wording,
  garbage/neutral/season-only all silent; `fixtures/greeting-test.js` (local, now 32) gains a
  night-active sweep asserting "this late-night" never renders and "tonight?" does. Browser-verified
  the full tea-detail render (cue + hint present, no console errors).

## v3.61 — greeting copy variety + APP_VERSION constant
Deploy: `steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-core.js`, `steep-settings.js`, `service-worker.js` (v71). No SQL.
- **Greeting copy variety** (steep-dashboard.js) — each greeting branch now draws from a small pool
  instead of one fixed line. `d_copyPick(pool, todayKey)` picks via `d_hash(todayKey+'|copy') %
  pool.length` — **one voice per calendar day**, seeded independently of the tea pick so it never
  reshuffles on re-render. Pools (Niklas-approved 2026-07-09): active-with-history (4), active-no-
  history (3), redirected-later-today (3), redirected-tomorrow (3), night (3), empty-state (2).
  Voice rules unchanged (warm, no exclamation/imperatives/guilt); the tea name stays the tap-target.
  Note: the active-with-history line "…this {bucket}?" renders "this late-night" for a night-active
  user (BUCKET_NOUN is 'late-night') — flagged for Niklas at the pause.
- **`APP_VERSION` constant** (steep-core.js, = 'v3.61') — the single source of truth for the user-
  visible version. Wired into the feedback mailto subject (was hardcoded 'v3.60') and a quiet
  "SlowCup v3.61" label in the Settings footer. **Added to the deploy ritual** (CLAUDE.md step 2b):
  bump it every deploy alongside CACHE_NAME.
- Extended `fixtures/greeting-test.js` (local) — now 30 assertions: per-branch pool membership across
  a 20-day sweep, ≥2 distinct lines per branch (variety), exactly one tea-name link per line, and
  same-day determinism of both the pick and the copy line. All green.

## v3.60 — error log + data health + feedback (Settings → Data)
Deploy: `steep-core.js`, `steep-settings.js`, `service-worker.js` (v70). No SQL.
- **Diagnostics log** (steep-core.js) — a device-local `tealog_errorLog` ring buffer (last 20,
  `{ts,message,source}`). `window.onerror` + `unhandledrejection` global hooks feed it, and `saveErr`
  now logs too — giving the v3.58 offline sync-failure the durable home its code comment promised.
  A logging path must never throw, so every access is wrapped. **Never surfaces proactively** — only
  viewable under Settings → Data (`errorLogHTML`, View/Clear; clear via `armConfirm`).
- **Data health** (steep-settings.js `dataHealthReport`) — on-demand, read-only, no auto-repair.
  Scans `state` for: sessions with a deleted tea, sessions with a deleted vessel, teas with negative
  stock, sessions with no steeps recorded, and possible duplicate pairs (same tea within 10 min —
  the v3.35 signature). Counts + first-8 details per finding; "everything checks out" when clean.
  **Note:** DB-orphaned steeps aren't observable client-side (the sessions load drops steeps whose
  parent session is gone), so the steep check surfaces the client-visible analog (empty sessions).
- **Send feedback** row — `mailto:slowcupapp@gmail.com`, subject "SlowCup v3.60 feedback"
  (hardcoded — no app-wide version constant exists yet; a future `APP_VERSION` could centralize it).
  No error-log auto-attach; the copy hints the log above can be copied in.
- Validated `fixtures/data-health-test.js` (local, reads the gitignored CSVs) over the real 2026-07-09
  export: **clean on all five detectors** (ZERO dup pairs, per the task ground truth); each detector fires on an injected bad
  row; negative controls hold (cold brew ≠ empty; 11 min apart ≠ dupe). Browser-verified the hooks +
  builders (ring cap 20, both global hooks capture, escaped output, no console errors).

## v3.59 — rename the app: Steep → SlowCup (user-facing brand only)
Deploy: `index.html`, `manifest.json`, `steep-core.js`, `steep-data.js`, `steep-settings.js`,
`steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-insights.js`, `steep-boot.js`, `service-worker.js` (v69). No SQL.
- **Visible product name only** — nothing structural. Repo name, GitHub Pages URL, `steep-*.js`
  file names, CSS classes, function names (`steepLogoSVG`), `tealog_*` localStorage keys, the
  `steep-tea-log-vNN` cache prefix, and Supabase are all untouched. The "steep / steeps" tea
  *terminology* (steep timer, "Steep 1", steep_order) stays — that's the verb, not the brand.
- Renamed: `index.html` `<title>` + `apple-mobile-web-app-title`; `manifest.json` `name`/`short_name`
  (fresh installs only); topbar `<h1>` + logo `aria-label` (steep-core); login screen `<h1>`
  (steep-data); backup filename `steep-tea-log-backup-…` → `slowcup-backup-…` + import toast
  (steep-settings — import still reads by *shape*, so old backups keep importing); `DASH_LABELS`
  "Steep Wrapped" → "SlowCup Wrapped" (steep-dashboard).
- **Beyond the task's audited list** (surfaced by a word-boundary grep, all user-facing brand):
  onboarding hero "Welcome to Steep" (steep-dashboard); the two Wrapped eyebrows + the Wrapped
  **share text** "· Steep" (steep-insights); the update banner "A new version of Steep is ready."
  (steep-boot); the local-data migration screen "This device has a local Steep log" (steep-data).
- Internal code comments/`[Steep]` console prefixes left as-is (not user-facing). Docs headings
  (CHANGELOG/STATE/ROADMAP) adopt the new name going forward; historical entries unchanged.

## v3.58 — finish the popup sweep (completes v3.50)
Deploy: `steep-settings.js`, `steep-core.js`, `steep-dashboard.js` (`showToast` gains a duration),
`service-worker.js` (v68). No SQL.
- **The last 8 browser popups are gone** — same conversions as v3.50 (`armConfirm` for destructive
  confirms, `showToast` for notices). No `alert()`/`confirm()`/`prompt()` remain in steep-settings.js.
- **Photo-migration** (steep-settings.js): the "no photos" and "moved N" alerts → toasts; the
  "Move N photos?" confirm → inline `armConfirm` on the button (`migratePhotosToStorage(this)` splits
  into an arm step + `doMigratePhotos()`).
- **Import** (steep-settings.js): the most destructive action (replaces ALL data) keeps its friction —
  the blocking `confirm()` becomes a **state-driven inline confirm row** in Settings → Data
  (`state.pendingImport` + `importConfirmHTML()`), still showing both counts ("Replace X teas /
  Y sessions with A / B?"), with a red "Replace all data" / "Cancel". Fires from a file-picker
  callback, so it can't use `armConfirm`'s button-in-place pattern — the row is durable in `state`.
  The invalid-file, read-error, and "Import complete" alerts → toasts.
- **Offline sync-failure** (steep-core.js `saveErr`): blocking `alert()` → a **long-lived toast**
  (~12s; it carries data-loss info). `showToast(msg, ms)` now takes an optional duration (default
  4.2s). v3.59's error log will give this failure a durable home via the global error hooks — noted
  in the code comment as the hand-off.
- Out of scope (unchanged): `socialErr` in steep-core.js keeps its `alert()` — social actions are
  online-only and it surfaces specific setup/permission diagnostics, not a calm notice.

## v3.57 — leaf-to-water ratio, the 3rd advice axis (brew advice v2, phase 1)
Deploy: `sql/v3_8-water-ml.sql` (**run once, first — already applied**), `steep-knowledge.js`,
`steep-core.js`, `steep-data.js`, `steep-sessions.js`, `steep-settings.js`, `service-worker.js` (v67).
SQL: `sessions.water_ml integer`, `sessions.brew_style text` (both nullable; old code ignores them).
- **The prefilled schedule now scales to how much leaf you used for the water volume** —
  `actualRatio = gramsUsed/(waterMl/100)` vs a per-method baseline; `timeFactor =
  clamp(1/ratioFactor^0.6, 0.6, 1.4)` applied to the whole schedule (curve shape preserved). A
  heavier pour shortens the times, a lighter one lengthens them. **Temp is NOT ratio-adjusted.**
- **Strict opt-in, default OFF** — Settings → Brew guidance → "Ratio adjustment" (`ratioAdjust`,
  in `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`). When off, none of the ratio path is reached and schedules are byte-identical
  to v3.56 (locked by `fixtures/ratio-test.js`).
- **Ordering:** base (guide or leaf-form) → **ratio** → feedback tuning (v3.25) → in-session timeShift
  (v3.30). `computeBrewAdvice(tea, baseOverride)` gained an optional pre-scaled base so feedback tunes
  the ratio-scaled schedule. Engine in steep-core.js: `computeSessionRatio`, `baselineRatioFor`,
  `ratioScaleSchedule`, `ratioMemoryText`, `brewMethodFor`, `bg_extractRatio`; tunables (`RATIO_K`,
  caps, `GONGFU_VESSEL_MAX_ML`, `METHOD_MISMATCH_MAX`, `LEAF_RATIO_DEFAULT`) sit next to LEAF_PROFILES.
- **Baseline order:** (a) grams+ml stated in the guide (`bg_extractRatio`, method-agnostic — "5g auf
  200ml" → 2.5) → (b) KB ratio *for the session's method* → (c) per-leaf-form default for the method.
- **Dual-method KB (steep-knowledge.js):** styles carry both methods where they differ —
  `ratioGongfu` on western-primary styles (greens 3.0, whites 4.5, yellow 3.5, puerh 5.0), `ratioWestern`
  on gongfu-primary (ball 0.8, dancong 1.0); strip/dark oolong anomaly fixed (western 1.5 + gongfu 4.5).
  **Japanese-green western values raised** to match Niklas's kyusu practice: sencha/shincha 1.8,
  kabusecha 2.0, fukamushi 1.8. Numbers agreed with Niklas 2026-07-09; documented in `knowledge/brew-guides.md`.
- **Session setup (opt-in on):** a quiet **Gongfu | Western** switch (prefilled from vessel capacity,
  `capacityMl ≤ 150 → gongfu`; flip per session) + an optional **Water (ml)** override (defaults to
  vessel capacity — absorbs the parked "partial fill" item). A ratio memory line in the guide preview:
  "Heavier pour than the baseline (4.5 vs 3.5 g/100ml) — times shortened ≈15%." The **method used is
  stored** (`brew_style`) for phase-2 learned defaults; cold brew + missing grams/water are silently
  excluded; a `METHOD_MISMATCH_MAX` (2.5) safety net holds off (and says so) rather than scale confidently-wrong.
- Mappers (`sessionFromDb`/`sessionToDb`) + both write paths carry `waterMl`/`brewStyle`.
- Validated in the Node vm sandbox over all 10 real timed sessions (`fixtures/ratio-test.js`, local, 47
  assertions): every actual→baseline→timeFactor matches the agreed dry-run; the two former −40% floors
  (Fujian White, Huang Ya) now land as gentle trims (0.89 / 0.98); opt-in-off byte-identical; ordering;
  cold-brew + missing-input exclusion; mismatch net. Roundtrip/accuracy/kb/greeting fixtures still green.

---
## v3.56 — capacity-capture precursor (brew advice v2, step 1)
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v66), `steep-sessions.js`. No SQL.
- **Groundwork for the leaf-to-water ratio axis (v3.57):** ratio needs each vessel's `capacityMl`,
  which is nullable and sparse. This makes capacity visible and gently encouraged — never required,
  never a banner, never blocks logging (calm-first). All three vessel/session views live in
  steep-sessions.js (steep-teas.js only hosts the Teas|Vessels segment that calls `viewVessels`), so
  this is a one-file behaviour change.
- **Vessel form:** the Capacity field gains a soft hint ("— helps tune brew advice by leaf-to-water
  ratio") and an example placeholder ("e.g. 110 for a gaiwan, 200 for a kyusu"). Still optional.
- **Vessels list:** a capacity-less vessel now shows a quiet "· ml?" affordance in the value slot
  (instead of blank) that taps straight to its edit form.
- **Session setup:** when the chosen vessel has no capacity, a quiet inline "set capacity — sharpens
  brew advice" link appears under the Vessel picker (`selVes`/`capLink`). It opens that vessel's edit
  form as an overlay; the session draft persists behind it (fields write to `state.sessionDraft`
  on input) and setup reappears on save/close. Never a modal that demands capacity, never blocks the
  log — matches the `showFinLink` pattern.

---
## v3.55 — greeting card v2: respect the user's real drinking window
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v65), `steep-dashboard.js`. No SQL.
- **The greeting no longer nudges a brew at a time the user never brews.** New active-window
  detection in `greetingCardHTML` (steep-dashboard.js): from all sessions, a time-of-day bucket
  (same 5–12 / 12–17 / 17–22 / else cutoffs as `timeOfDayBuckets`) is *active* if it holds ≥2
  sessions **or** ≥15% of the total. Requires ≥5 sessions of signal; below that, unchanged v3.54
  behaviour (too little to claim "you never brew now").
- **In an active bucket** → exactly the v3.54 behaviour (suggest for now, "your {bucket} pick").
- **In an inactive bucket** → scan the daily cycle forward (`BUCKET_CYCLE`) to the next active
  bucket and suggest FOR that window with forward-looking copy; the greeting line (h2) still tells
  the truth about now. Night (spans midnight) → "The {name} will be waiting for the morning." (no
  "tomorrow" claim); a wrap past night into next morning → "Maybe save the {name} for tomorrow
  {bucket}."; a later-today active window → "Maybe save the {name} for {this afternoon/…}."
- **Scoring targets the destination bucket** (bucketCount vs the target, not now); `brewedToday`
  exclusion applies only when the target window is still today (tomorrow's suggestion may repeat
  today's tea). Date-seeded deterministic pick unchanged.
- Copy rules unchanged: no imperative, no "!", never "you haven't logged"; tea name → `openTeaDetail`.
- Validated in the Node vm sandbox against the fresh CSVs (`fixtures/greeting-test.js`, local, now
  reading from `fixtures/`): with Niklas's real data (morning 7 / afternoon 5 active; evening 0 /
  night 0 inactive) 22:00 → forward-looking morning copy, 19:00 → "tomorrow morning", 09:00 →
  unchanged now-copy, <5 sessions → v3.54 behaviour; redirect pick deterministic; brewed-today
  excluded only in an active (today) window. 21 assertions green.

---
## v3.54 — greeting card in the old persona slot
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v64), `steep-dashboard.js`. No SQL.
- **A calm, ritual-first greeting replaces the removed persona banner.** New `greeting` card
  (`greetingCardHTML` in steep-dashboard.js), first in `DASH_DEFAULT_ORDER`, `DASH_LABELS.greeting`,
  `DASH_SURFACE.greeting='home'` — hideable/movable like any card; old saved `dashLayout`s pick it up
  via the unknown-id append.
- **Greeting line:** four local-hour buckets matching `timeOfDayBuckets` (5–12 / 12–17 / 17–22 / else)
  → "Good morning / afternoon / evening" / "A quiet night", Fraunces, h2-sized, on a plain `var(--jade-pale)`
  card (no gradient — quieter than persona).
- **Suggestion:** one tea, **deterministic per calendar day** (date-seeded FNV-1a tie-break, no `Math.random`
  so it doesn't reshuffle on re-render). Candidates = not finished (`isTeaFinished` false) and not brewed
  today; score = sessions in the CURRENT time-of-day bucket + small rating/favorite nudges. Copy: "Maybe the
  {name}? It's been your {bucket} pick." (name → `openTeaDetail`), or a neutral "Maybe the {name} this
  {when}?" when the pick has no bucket history — never a false claim, no button, no imperative, no "!".
- **Fallbacks:** no sessions → "The kettle's patient whenever you are."; no candidate teas → greeting alone.
  Never mentions streaks, gaps, or "you haven't logged" — calm-first, zero guilt.
- The task's optional seasonal word ("a warm July evening") is deliberately omitted — warm/cold is
  hemisphere-dependent and we don't know the user's, so a plain time-of-day line stays safe.
- Validated in the Node vm sandbox against the real teas/sessions CSVs (`fixtures/greeting-test.js`, local):
  correct bucket at mocked hours, stable same-day pick, finished/zero-stock never suggested, brewed-today
  excluded, both empty-state fallbacks. Card styling checked in the preview (Fraunces 22px, jade-pale bg,
  jade-deep underlined link) in light + dark.

---
## v3.53 — retire Pixelify Sans → IBM Plex Mono
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v63), `index.html`, `styles.css`, `steep-settings.js`, `steep-core.js`. No SQL.
- **The pixel font is gone.** `--font-mono` is now `'IBM Plex Mono',ui-monospace,'SF Mono',Menlo,Consolas,monospace`;
  the Google Fonts `<link>` loads `IBM+Plex+Mono:wght@400;500;600;700` (weights used by `.pill`, `.badge-title`,
  `.stat .num`, `.timer-display`). Every `.mono`/`.eyebrow`/`.stat .num`/`.timer-display` etc. inherits it.
- **The Pixel/Clean "Display font" toggle is retired** — it only existed to escape the pixel look. Removed the
  Settings `set-row`, `monoFont` from `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, the `html[data-mono="clean"]` CSS block, and the
  `data-mono` `setAttribute` in the theme applier (`applySettings` is now a no-op kept for its call sites). A
  leftover `monoFont` key in already-synced settings is harmless — no migration.
- **Eyebrow tracking `.1em → .06em`.** IBM Plex Mono runs wider than Pixelify; at `.1em` the long
  "Suggested brew · <leaf-form> family · auto" eyebrows wrapped to two lines on 375px. Tightening to `.06em`
  (still clearly letter-spaced) reclaims the borderline ones without shrinking any font-size. Verified in the
  preview at 375px: eyebrow computes to IBM Plex Mono, `letter-spacing:0.66px`, and the woff2 loads over the wire.

---
## v3.52 — remove the Tea persona card
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v62, shared with v3.51), `steep-dashboard.js`, `styles.css`. No SQL.
- **The "Your tea persona" Home banner is gone** — `computePersona`, the `persona` dashboard card
  (removed from `DASH_DEFAULT_ORDER`/`DASH_LABELS`/`DASH_SURFACE` and `dashCardsHome`), and the
  `.persona` CSS block. Saved `dashLayout`s self-heal: `dashLayout()` filters unknown ids, so a
  persisted `persona` entry in order/hidden/surface is silently dropped on next render.
- Alternatives to fill that slot (a calmer identity surface) are under discussion — see ROADMAP note.

## v3.51 — tea detail: structured card for saved brew guides
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v62), `steep-teas.js`. No SQL.
- **Teas WITH a saved guide now get the same structured brew card** (temp / rinse / first steeps)
  the suggested-brew card introduced in v3.48 — new `savedBrewHTML(tea)` parses the guide via
  `effectiveGuideSchedule(tea, true)`, labeled "Brew guide · saved". The raw guide text stays
  visible inside the card, so nothing the user wrote disappears.
- **Temp-only guides** (e.g. Ruby Ruanzhi's "80-90°C") show the leaf-form schedule the timer would
  actually run, with a footnote saying the times come from the leaf type — generated times are never
  passed off as the user's own.
- Gated like the suggested card: `brewAdvice` off, or a guide that parses to nothing, falls back to
  the old plain "How to brew" text block.
- Validated in the Node vm sandbox against all 14 real tea rows: 11/11 guides render the card
  (Shincha's "60-75°C / 15-30s / 3 infusions" → 68°C · 15/23/30s; range-midpoints and the single-range
  spread behave), temp-only generates with `generated:true`, `brewAdvice=false` falls back to plain.

## v3.50 — sweep confirm()/alert() → inline UI (sessions + teas)
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v61), `steep-core.js`, `steep-sessions.js`, `steep-teas.js`. No SQL.
- **No more browser popups in steep-sessions/steep-teas.** New shared **`armConfirm(btn, message, onYes)`**
  (steep-core.js): a destructive button hides itself in place and shows "message · Yes / Cancel" right
  after it via DOM — non-blocking, and **no re-render**, so unsaved form fields nearby survive (verified:
  typing an edit in the tea form then arming Delete keeps the text). Any later `render()` just redraws the
  plain button. The 5 `confirm()`s converted: remove vessel, remove steep, delete session, discard session
  log, delete tea.
- **The 5 `alert()`s → `showToast`** (existing non-blocking notice): min-steep guard, "add a tea/vessel
  first", "enter a steep time", "log at least one steep".
- **Guards verified per site** (v3.37 re-entrancy): only `deleteSession` has one (`_sessionSaving`), and
  since the action now fires directly on Yes it still protects the stock-readd on a double-click — no flow
  depended on `confirm()` blocking. Verified the stock readd (20→26g) still runs exactly once.
- Remaining popups (out of scope): steep-settings bulk import / photo-migrate, and steep-core's
  offline-sync error `alert()`.

## v3.49 — brew-guide emitter round-trips exactly (+ permanent test)
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v60), `steep-core.js`, `steep-teas.js`. No SQL.
- **`scheduleToGuideText` now emits times in raw seconds** (`75s`, not `fmtSecShort`'s `1m15s`). The
  compound `1m15s` token was unparseable by `parseBrewGuide`/`bg_extractTimes`: it read back as `60s`
  *and* truncated the run after it, so any schedule with a steep ≥60s + remainder silently corrupted
  on the schedule → text → parse round-trip. This bit **`saveTuningToGuide`** (save-tuning-as-guide),
  not just v3.48's suggestion save. Raw seconds round-trip exactly for every value.
- **`saveSuggestedGuide` now reuses `scheduleToGuideText`** (was a near-duplicate emitter) so there's a
  single, tested formatter; the KB ratio is still appended after.
- **New permanent test `fixtures/brew-roundtrip-test.js`** (82 checks): for every LEAF_PROFILES family
  (× steep counts) and every KB style, `schedule → scheduleToGuideText → parseBrewGuide` must reproduce
  the identical times, plus adversarial ≥60s-remainder cases and a guard that the emitter never emits a
  compound minute token. This is committed (unlike the CSV-driven fixtures) via a `.gitignore` exception,
  since it generates from committed source and needs no private data — so it catches this bug class for
  good, including future emitter changes. Negative-control-verified (buggy emitter fails it).

## v3.48 — Suggested brew on tea detail (for teas without a guide)
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v59), `steep-teas.js`. No SQL.
- **Tea detail now shows a "Suggested brew" card when a tea has no saved brew guide** — the same
  schedule the session timer would generate (`effectiveGuideSchedule`'s KB/leaf-form path): temp,
  leaf ratio, and the first steeps. Clearly marked as a suggestion (calm jade-pale card, "not a saved
  guide" note), never shown when a real guide exists (that path still renders "How to brew").
- **One-line source label:** a matched KB style names itself (`Suggested brew · dancong style`);
  otherwise the inferred leaf-form family with the `· auto` marker (`Strip / open leaf family · auto`).
  Temp + ratio come from the KB when a style matched; a leaf-form-only fallback shows just the steeps.
- **Save-as-guide button** writes the suggestion into `brewGuide` (`saveSuggestedGuide`), after which
  the tea reads as a normal guided tea. Times are written in **raw seconds** (`75s`, not `fmtSecShort`'s
  `1m15s`, which `parseBrewGuide` reads back as 60s) so the saved guide round-trips to exactly the
  schedule shown; the KB ratio is appended (`4g/100ml`) and harmlessly stripped on re-parse.
- Gated on the same `brewAdvice` opt-out as the in-session generated schedule (calm-first: no generated
  guidance when the toggle is off). Verified in the browser sandbox across KB-match / leaf-form-only /
  already-guided teas + save round-trip; `node --check` green.

## v3.47 — move dashboard cards between Home and Insights
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v58), `steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-insights.js`. No SQL.
- **Edit mode can now move a card to the other tab.** Each card's edit chrome gains a `→ Insights`
  (on Home) / `→ Home` (on Insights) chip next to ↑ ↓ Hide. `dashMoveToSurface` records a per-user
  override in `settings.dashLayout.surface` (id→'home'|'insights') that `dashSurface` layers over the
  built-in `DASH_SURFACE`; moving a card back to its built-in surface clears the override (no-op
  overrides don't accumulate). The card lands at the bottom of the destination tab; within-tab ↑ ↓
  reorder then works as before.
- **Both tabs now build the full card map** via a shared `dashCards()` (= `dashCardsHome(s)` in
  steep-dashboard + `dashCardsInsights(s)` in steep-insights, one shared `computeStats`). A moved card
  must have its HTML available on whichever tab it lands on; the old split (each view built only its
  own cards) couldn't render a card on the other surface. `viewDashboard`/`viewInsights` are now thin
  wrappers over `renderDashboard(dashCards(), surface)`.
- **Migration-safe:** old saved `dashLayout` (no `surface` key) falls through to `DASH_SURFACE`
  unchanged; `saveDashLayout` preserves the override across hide/reorder; `dashResetLayout` clears it.
- Verified in the Node/browser sandbox: cross-tab move + land-at-bottom, within-tab reorder, move-back
  clears override, reset, and surface persistence across hide ops. `node --check` green.

## v3.46 — Vessels folded into the Teas tab
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v57), `steep-core.js`, `steep-teas.js`, `steep-sessions.js`. No SQL.
- **Nav is now Home · Teas · Sessions · Insights** — the Vessels tab is gone. Vessels live under Teas
  behind a segmented control (Teas | Vessels), following the v3.18 vendor-manager precedent of folding a
  surface into Teas. `state.teaSeg` ('teas'|'vessels') tracks the active segment; `viewTeas` renders the
  vessels segment via the existing `viewVessels()` (in `steep-sessions.js`), so vessel add/edit/delete are
  unchanged.
- **Deep-links preserved.** `goView('vessels')` and any stray `state.view='vessels'` route to
  `goVessels()` → Teas tab, Vessels segment. The onboarding "Add vessel" button and the "add a vessel
  first" guard on session start both land there. Pre-v3.46 persisted `tealog_view='vessels'` is remapped
  at init (dropped from `PERSISTED_VIEWS`). `render()` keeps a defensive `view==='vessels'` guard.
- `node --check` green on all three touched files.

## v3.45 — nav tidy: Insights last, Friends to the icon row
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v56), `steep-core.js`. No SQL.
- **Tabs now read Home · Teas · Sessions · Vessels · Insights** — the main tab row concentrates on
  "all things tea", with Insights moved to the end (no longer the second tab).
- **Friends moved to a 👥 icon in the top action row** (next to shopping / passport / settings), via
  `goFriends()`. Frees a tab slot and keeps the primary nav tea-focused. Friends stays fully functional.
- Migration re-validated against Niklas's real saved `dashLayout` (v3.44): his reorder (wrapped before
  recap) and hidden `recent` are preserved with no cross-tab leakage. `node --check` + render suites green.

## v3.44 — Insights tab + dashboard split
Deploy: `index.html`, `service-worker.js` (v55), **new** `steep-insights.js`, `steep-dashboard.js`,
`steep-core.js`. No SQL.
- **Nav gains an Insights tab.** Home now leads with the calm, at-a-glance cards; the analytics move
  to Insights. **Home:** persona, cost overview, running-low, brewing clock, recent sessions, totals,
  favorites. **Insights:** Recap, Steep Wrapped, the Insights reading, "What you brewed" (type
  breakdown), Most-brewed / Top-rated. (Heatmap + streak stay on the Sessions tab, per Niklas — they
  were never on Home.)
- **New module `steep-insights.js`** owns the analytics cards + `viewInsights()` — the tab is the seam
  that splits `steep-dashboard.js` (~1040 → ~740 lines), addressing review finding #10. Added to
  `index.html` load order + `FILES_TO_CACHE`; module map in CLAUDE.md.
- **Surface-aware editable layout.** The `dashLayout` registry gains `DASH_SURFACE` (each card's home
  surface); `renderDashboard(cards, surface)` filters per tab, and reorder/hide work per-tab. Migration
  is automatic and lossless: existing saved `{order,hidden}` keep their visibility and gain surfaces
  from the constant — **nothing a user hid can reappear** (validated).
- **Recap gains an "All time" option** (alongside This week / This month).
- Validated in a vm sandbox against real fixtures: a representative pre-split `dashLayout` migrates with
  hidden cards preserved and no cross-tab leakage; `viewDashboard()`/`viewInsights()` render only their
  own cards — 16 checks green; all prior suites (XSS/KB/lifecycle/tea-order/brew-accuracy) still green;
  `node --check` clean.

## v3.43 — silver needle glass note
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v54), `steep-knowledge.js`. Reference: `knowledge/brew-guides.md`
(Fujian Silver Needle entry added; removed from pending stubs). No SQL.
- `KB_STYLES.silver_needle` keeps its gongfu baseline (80°C / 1.5 / 90 s) but the note now records the
  classic **glass** method too: "also classic in glass: 80°C, ~4 min" (Teasenz / Fuding). Values
  unchanged; note only. `node --check` + KB suite green.

## v3.42 — brew accuracy: leaf-form retune + KB-first generation
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v53), `steep-core.js`, `steep-knowledge.js`. Reference: batch-2 entries
merged into `knowledge/brew-guides.md`. No SQL.
- **`LEAF_PROFILES` retune** (from `knowledge/brew-guides.md` batch 2). The oolong/bud/compressed
  families now encode the **opening dip** (2nd steep shorter than 1st) that vendors + Niklas's logs
  confirm, and bases move to the moderate/gaiwan school: `rolled` base 45 mult [1,0.6,0.6,0.75,0.95,1.2]
  growth 1.12; `open` base 40 mult [1,0.7,0.9,1.15,1.45,1.9]; `bud` base 55 mult [1,0.8,1.0,1.25,1.6];
  `compressed` base 22 mult [1,0.9,1.0,1.2,1.5,1.9]. **Greens unchanged.**
- **KB `first` as generation base.** When `kbResolve` matches a style, its canonical first-steep length
  is used as the `generateFormTimes` base over the family base (via a new `baseOverride`), so dancong
  opens at 25s, Tie Guan Yin at 45s, etc. while sharing the family's dip/growth shape.
- **KB updates:** `ball_oolong` tempC 95 / ratio 3.5 / first 45; `longjing` tempC 78.
- Validated against real `fixtures/steeps`: generated oolong schedules land in the logged corridor —
  **Ali Shan generates 45/27/27**, matching TKK's printed 45→25→25 and inside the 60→35→60 shape; every
  oolong shows the dip. 18 brew-accuracy checks green; KB/lifecycle/tea-order/XSS suites still green;
  `node --check` clean.

## v3.41 — dancong brew baseline (knowledge layer)
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v52), `steep-knowledge.js`. New reference file `knowledge/brew-guides.md`
(not app-loaded/cached — a growing vendor-sourced knowledge layer). No SQL.
- **Phoenix/Feng Huang dancong split into its own KB style.** New `KB_STYLES.dancong`
  (`oolong`/`strip`, **90°C**, ratio 4.0, first 25s) distilled from three vendor sources — cooler =
  sweeter, hotter = stronger; unforgiving; second steep shorter than first. Source table + rationale in
  `knowledge/brew-guides.md`.
- **Remapped the dancong-family keywords** (`dan cong`, `dancong`, `ya shi xiang`, `yashi xiang`,
  `mi lan xiang`, `phoenix`, `feng huang`, `huang zhi xiang`) from `strip_oolong` → `dancong`. Wuyi
  yancha (`da hong pao`, `rou gui`, `shui xian`, `wuyi`, `yancha`, baozhong/pouchong) stays
  `strip_oolong`. Leaf form is unchanged (both map to the `open` curve family), so `inferLeafForm`
  output for existing teas is identical.
- **`knowledge/` folder** = growing reference layer feeding KB baselines; not loaded by the app.
  Consult it when tuning brew defaults (noted in CLAUDE.md).
- Curve-retune note (deferred, in ROADMAP): all three sources — even the flash-steep gongfu school —
  show the **second steep shorter than the first**, so the opening-dip multipliers should extend to the
  oolong `LEAF_PROFILES` curves (`rolled`/`open`), not just greens.
- Validated: `kbResolve("Yashi Xiang Dancong Guandong")` → `dancong` at 90°C; aliases resolve; Wuyi
  stays strip; 32 KB checks green; `node --check` clean.

## v3.40 — tea lifecycle (finished teas)
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v51), `steep-core.js`, `steep-teas.js`, `steep-sessions.js`. No SQL.
- **Finished vs unknown boundary.** A tea is *finished* only when its grams are **tracked** and ≤0;
  an untracked amount of 0 is treated as in-stock (unknown ≠ empty — the DB defaults `amount_grams`
  to 0, so 0 alone is ambiguous). "Tracked" = current amount >0, OR a recorded purchase quantity
  (`costOriginalGrams`), OR a session that drew it down (`gramsUsed`). New `isAmountTracked` /
  `isTeaFinished` in steep-core.
- **Teas tab** — finished teas group at the bottom under a muted "Finished" divider (count shown);
  their card shows "finished" instead of "0.0g left".
- **Session tea picker** — finished teas hidden by default behind a quiet "show finished (N)" link;
  revealed as a trailing "Finished" `<optgroup>`. They stay fully loggable (re-weighed tins, a true
  last session), and are always shown if the current selection is itself finished. A new session now
  defaults to an in-stock tea.
- **One-time "rebuy?" affordance** on a finished tea's card — Yes → shopping list (via
  `addWishFromTea`) + sets `would_rebuy`; No → dismiss. Device-local memory (`tealog_rebuyAsked`),
  no banners/modals.
- **Stats integrity:** finished teas still count everywhere (Wrapped, passport, insights, totals) —
  only the pickers and the Teas-tab default view treat them apart. No explicit archive state yet.
- Validated against real `fixtures/` (the untracked "Test" tea stays in-stock, not finished) plus
  synthetic boundary cases — 9 checks green; XSS/KB/tea-order tests still green; `node --check` clean.

## v3.39 — tea picker grouped by type
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v50), `steep-core.js`, `steep-teas.js`, `steep-sessions.js`. No SQL.
- **Session tea picker groups teas by type** — green · white · yellow · oolong · black · puerh · herbal
  (that order), alphabetical within each group, each group a `<optgroup>` header. New shared helpers
  `TYPE_ORDER` / `groupTeasByType` / `sortTeasByTypeThenName` in steep-core.
- **Teas tab default sort is now the same "By type" ordering** (new first option in the sort dropdown;
  `state.teaSort` defaults to `'type'`). Picking any other sort still overrides it — grouping is only
  the default, not forced. (Note: this took the v3.39 slot; the planned Insights tab shifts to v3.40.)
- Validated against real `fixtures/teas_rows.csv`: group order = TYPE_ORDER, alpha within, flat sort =
  grouped concat — 9 checks green; XSS + KB tests still green; `node --check` clean.

## v3.38 — tea knowledge base (fixes leaf-form inference misses)
Deploy: `index.html`, `service-worker.js` (v49), **new** `steep-knowledge.js`, `steep-core.js`,
`steep-teas.js`. No SQL.
- **New module `steep-knowledge.js`** — a curated tea knowledge base (`kbResolve(text)` →
  `{style,type,leafForm,tempC,ratio,first,country}` by longest-alias match over style keywords +
  cultivars + regions, EN/DE terms). Loads before `steep-core` (added to `index.html` and
  `FILES_TO_CACHE`).
- **`inferLeafForm` consults the KB first** (name + cultivar + origin), then maps the KB's finer
  leafForm vocabulary onto our six `LEAF_PROFILES` families via `KB_LEAFFORM_TO_PROFILE`. This fixes
  the long-parked misses: Japanese cultivars/regions (Saemidori, Yutakamidori, Kabusecha, Kagoshima,
  Shincha…) now infer **steamed green** (`green_jp`), and silver-bud whites (Yunnan Silver Bud, Ya Bao)
  infer **bud** — previously they fell through to pan-fired/wrong families. Falls back to the existing
  name/type heuristics when the KB doesn't match; guarded so a missing KB never throws.
- **Gentle KB prefill in the tea form** — as you type a name on a *new* tea, if the KB recognises it and
  type/origin aren't already set, a dismissible "Looks like {type} from {country}" line offers **Use
  this** (calm-first: suggested, never auto-applied). leafForm is left to `inferLeafForm`. Non-`TYPES`
  KB types (e.g. herbal) are never suggested.
- Validated against real `fixtures/teas_rows.csv`: every tea infers a valid `LEAF_PROFILES` family
  (no `leafFormLabel` crash) and the parked cases resolve correctly — 25 checks green; XSS render test
  still green. `node --check` clean on all four JS files.

## v3.37 — hygiene: re-entrancy guards, date preservation, dedupes
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v48), `steep-sessions.js`, `steep-teas.js`, `steep-social.js`,
`steep-data.js`, `steep-core.js`, `steep-dashboard.js`. No SQL.
- **Re-entrancy guards** on `deleteSession` (shared `_sessionSaving`) and the three async form
  submits — `submitTeaForm`, `submitVesselForm`, `submitProfile` (per-form `_*Saving` flags, set on
  entry, cleared in `finally`). Each does an `await` before mutating `state`, so a double-tapped
  Save/Delete could otherwise double-apply (a duplicate tea/vessel, or a double stock add-back on
  delete — the same class as the v3.35 commitSession fix, which now guards delete too, forward-safe
  for when the legacy `confirm()` is replaced with inline UI).
- **Preserve original creation date across import/restore.** `teaToDb` now sends `created_at` when
  `t.dateAdded` is present (a no-op on update since dateAdded mirrors the DB value; an insert-time
  preserve for imported teas) and omits it when absent so new rows still get the default `now()`.
  Fixes restored teas all looking brand-new — wrong "newest" sort and Wrapped "teas you met".
- **Dedupe:** the persisted-view allowlist is now one `PERSISTED_VIEWS` const (was duplicated in init
  restore + `saveView`); the time-of-day bucketing is one `timeOfDayBuckets()` helper (was inlined
  verbatim in Insights + Wrapped). Cut the unused exported `getFollowers`.
- Validated: `node --check` on all six files; a guard/mapper logic test (guarded double-fire pushes
  once vs twice; created_at sent/omitted correctly) and the v3.36 XSS render test both green.

## v3.36 — security: escape all user text in rendered HTML (XSS fix)
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v47), `steep-core.js`, `steep-social.js`, `steep-teas.js`,
`steep-sessions.js`, `steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-shopping.js`, `steep-passport.js`,
`steep-settings.js`. No SQL.
- **One shared `escapeHtml` (+ `escapeJsArg`) in `steep-core.js`**, and every render site that
  interpolates user-entered text now escapes the data value (never the surrounding markup). Replaces
  the four inconsistent per-module `esc()` copies (teas ×2, shopping, dashboard, passport).
- **Fixes stored cross-user XSS in the social feed** (the #1 finding): another user's `displayName`,
  `bio`, `username`, session `description`, `teaName`, `tags`, `vesselName`, and `photoUrl` were
  rendered raw into `innerHTML`, so a crafted profile/shared session ran arbitrary JS in every viewer's
  session. Now escaped. Also swept all own-content surfaces (tea/vessel/session/steep names, notes,
  origin/cultivar/source, brew guide, tags, wishlist, spend/recap/Wrapped/rankings, form value attrs).
- **`escapeJsArg` for inline `onclick` string arguments** — JS-string-escape then HTML-escape, so a
  value dropped into `onclick="fn('…')"` can't break out of the JS string or the attribute.
- Validated with a fixture-driven render test (`fixtures/xss-render-test.js`, gitignored): a tea named
  `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` plus a quotes/umlauts description renders **inert** (escaped, no live
  `<img>`/`<script>`) through the real render functions, while umlauts and quotes still display
  correctly — 24 checks green. `node --check` clean on all nine changed files.

## v3.35 — fix: double stock decrement on save (re-entrancy guard)
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v46), `steep-sessions.js`. No SQL.
- **Logging a session no longer subtracts `gramsUsed` from tea stock twice.** Root cause was a
  re-entrant double-fire of `commitSession` (async, with an `await resolveDraftImage()` gap before the
  decrement and `state.sessionDraft` cleared only at the end, and the Save button never disabled): a
  second tap read the same draft and applied the read-modify-write stock decrement to the same in-memory
  tea again — subtracting twice and pushing a duplicate session. Fixed with a shared `_sessionSaving`
  re-entrancy guard (set on entry, cleared in `finally`) on both `commitSession` and `saveSessionEdit`.
  The offline write-queue was ruled out — it replays absolute-value `putTea` upserts, which are
  idempotent. Verified against real exported rows (`fixtures/`) with a Node repro: the two-overlapping-
  saves case went 32g→20g (two sessions) before, 32g→26g (one session) after; the queue-replay case was
  correct both ways. (`fixtures/` is gitignored — repro not committed.)

## v3.34 — settings declutter + vessel edit (map parked)
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v45), `steep-core.js`, `steep-settings.js`, `steep-sessions.js`. No SQL.
- **Settings grouped into sections.** The flat list was getting long; now organised under labelled
  headings (`.eyebrow`): Brewing · Brew guidance · Session check-in · Inventory · Appearance ·
  Calm & achievements · Data. No behaviour change, just scannability.
- **Hide the mood check-in.** New `showMood` setting (default on) under "Session check-in". Off hides the
  "how are you feeling?" step in session setup and in the edit modal — but the edit modal still shows it
  for any session that already has a mood recorded, so nothing gets trapped. (This one switch is the
  intended future Garmin on/off for the correlation epic.)
- **Brew-guide + advice grouped.** Both toggles now live under one "Brew guidance" block, each still
  independently switchable (or both off). Same `brewGuideAutofill` / `brewAdvice` settings, reorganised.
- **Change the vessel on a saved session** (ships in this batch). Edit-session modal gains a Vessel
  selector (shows capacity where set); Save recomputes `vesselName`; a since-deleted vessel keeps its
  old name as the current option so nothing silently changes.
- **Map: parked, not shipped.** The v3.33 dot-map (and a legibility pass built on it) was rejected —
  you can't recognise countries/borders, "just dots." Held pending a redesign with drawn country
  outlines. The parsing layer is reusable; only the dot rendering gets replaced. See ROADMAP/STATE.

---
## v3.33 — curated passport: sub-regions + China/Japan zoom
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v44), `steep-passport.js`, `steep-core.js`. No SQL.
- **Sub-region layer on the tea passport.** Beyond the country pins, teas now resolve to a
  curated sub-region (`PASSPORT_SUB`) placed by real lat/lon on the same grid — Kagoshima, Fukuoka,
  Uji, Shizuoka (Japan); Yunnan, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Guangxi (China); Alishan, Nantou,
  Lishan (Taiwan). `passportSubFor(country,tea)` matches within the parent country only (origin first,
  then name — so "Ali Shan…" places even when origin is just "Taiwan"), longest-alias-wins.
- **Tap China or Japan → zoom into sub-regions.** Selecting a zoomable country retargets the SVG
  viewBox to a window around it (reuses the existing `PASSPORT_LAND` dots — no new geometry) and draws
  sub-region pins sized by tea count, plus a faint marker for region-unspecified teas. "← Zoom out"
  returns to the overview; zoomable countries carry a dashed amber ring + `⊕` on their chip.
- Detail panel gains sub-region chips (incl. "Region unspecified"); tapping one filters the tea list.
- Verified with the real library in a Node sandbox: Japan→Kagoshima ×3 / Fukuoka ×1; China→Guangdong,
  Yunnan, Anhui (Huoshan Huangya) + 2 unspecified; Taiwan→Alishan (from name); all render paths clean.
- New `state`: `passportZoom`, `passportSub` (reset on view change). No schema change.

---
## v3.32 — forecast coverage + brew-guide parse + reload fixes
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v43), `steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-core.js`, `steep-teas.js`. No SQL.
- **Stock forecast now covers any brewed tea.** Old rule needed 2+ grams-logged sessions, so a tea
  with one weighed session (or sessions where grams weren't typed) showed nothing — while purchase-date
  teas predicted from the ledger. New model = **frequency × dose**: sessions/day (across *all* the tea's
  sessions, incl. cold brew and grams-less ones) × average logged dose, needing just one grams entry to
  anchor. Ledger still preferred when present. (Kabusecha/Ruby/Sencha/Huang Ya now predict.) `teaForecast`.
- **Brew-guide parser — range spreading.** A lone time-range now spreads start→end across the infusion
  count: `60-75°C, 15-30s, 3 infusions` → 68°C, steeps [15, 23, 30] (was one 23s steep). Temperature
  ranges read as midpoint (`60-75°C` → 68°C). German "Aufguss/Aufgüsse" counts recognised. Multi-range
  guides (DHP `10-15s / 15-20s`) still read as one steep each. `parseBrewGuide`.
- **Reload stays on the tea.** Viewing a tea and refreshing now restores that tea's page instead of
  bouncing to Home (tea-detail route persisted alongside the tab route). `openTeaDetail`/boot restore.

## v3.31 — mood/energy check-in (enabler)
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v42), `steep-sessions.js`, `steep-data.js`, `steep-teas.js`.
SQL: `v3_7-mood.sql` (adds nullable `sessions.mood`).
- **Optional pre-brew mood/energy** at session setup (Drained · Low · Steady · Lively · Wired),
  one tap, skippable, applies to cold brew too. Captured *before* you start so it's tied to the
  session and time of day — the reading the later Garmin/caffeine-sleep correlation (Tier 4) leans on.
  Editable afterwards on the session-edit form. Stored in `sessions.mood`; `MOODS`/`moodChipsHTML`/
  `d_setMood`/`setEditSessionMood` in steep-sessions.
- **Fix:** removed the leaf-form line from the tea detail page (looked cluttered) — the field still
  lives in the tea edit form, it's just no longer auto-listed on the detail grid.

## v3.30 — in-session micro-adjust
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v41), `steep-sessions.js`. No SQL.
- **Adjustments now stick.** Previously each steep re-prefilled from the fixed schedule, so lowering
  a steep's time did nothing — the next steep snapped back to the guide's upward march. A session-local
  `timeShift` now carries the gap between what you actually brewed and what the schedule predicted, so
  the next steep continues from where you landed (the curve still rises, but from your level). Clamped
  ±45s, reset on brew-mode change and each new session. Ephemeral — the tea's saved guide is untouched.
- **"How was that pour?"** After the first steep, a small Weak → longer / Just right / Strong → shorter
  row nudges the next steep ±5s without retyping, showing the live offset ("next steep −6s vs guide").
  Same weak/ok/strong vocabulary as the between-session advice, at per-steep granularity.
  (`d_nudgeNextSteep`, `brewNudgeRowHTML`, carry logic in `saveSteepAndContinue`/`applyScheduleToCurrentSteep`.)

## v3.29 — leaf-form steep curves + seconds-first advice
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v40), `steep-core.js`, `steep-sessions.js`, `steep-teas.js`, `steep-data.js`.
SQL: `v3_6-leaf-form.sql` (adds nullable `teas.leaf_form`).
- **Leaf form drives the steep progression.** Steep times now follow *leaf morphology*, not a single
  ramp. Six families, each with its own curve: rolled/balled (opens slowly → small early increments),
  strip/open leaf (strong early → ramps from the start), bud/needle (slow, steady, long), green
  pan-fired (Chinese — S2 flash-dip then climb), green steamed (Japanese — deeper dip, lower base),
  compressed/cake (breaks & opens like rolled). `LEAF_PROFILES` + `scheduleTimeForIndex` (now
  form-aware) in steep-core.
- **New `leafForm` field on teas** (Auto by default). Auto **infers from the name first**
  (cultivar/region/leaf: Da Hong Pao/Wuyi/yancha→open, gyokuro/sencha→steamed, silver needle/
  yinzhen→bud, cake/bing/tuo→compressed) then the type default — because vendor type labels are
  unreliable. Overridable per tea; shown on tea detail. Nullable column, no backfill.
- **Suggested schedules with no guide.** A tea with no brew guide now gets a leaf-form-generated
  schedule in setup (labelled "Suggested · <form>"), so the timer prefills sensibly from day one.
  Explicit guide times always win; the curve only fills gaps and **extrapolates past the last listed
  steep** (validated against a real Da Hong Pao card: 10-15s/15-20s + "add 5-10s each" → 13, 18, 24,
  30, 38, 47, 57s).
- **Parser hardening.** `parseBrewGuide` now understands ranges ("10-15s" → midpoint), ordinals
  ("1st/2nd"), and "add 5-10s (each/thereafter)" ramp instructions (dropped, not read as a steep) —
  so real-world guide text stops producing junk steeps. Slash/comma/clock notations unchanged.
- **Advice in seconds, not percent.** The tuning suggestion reads "≈+5s/steep" off a representative
  steep instead of "+8%", since a percentage is hard to act on mid-brew. (`adviceSuggestionText`.)

## v3.28 — inventory-over-time + restock v2
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v39), `steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-teas.js`. No SQL.
- **Sharper run-out estimate.** `teaForecast` now prefers a *purchase-date ledger* — real net
  drawdown `(grams bought − on hand) ÷ days since purchase` — over the old session-span guess.
  It's anchored to a real buy date and captures untracked use too, so "how long will this last"
  is meaningfully sharper on any tea logged with a price/pack size + purchase date. Falls back to
  the session estimate when there's no usable anchor; guarded against bad data (on-hand > bought,
  <3 days elapsed). Return shape is unchanged, so the Home "Running low" card and the tea-detail
  forecast line both sharpen with no other edits. The line adds a quiet "· from your purchase date"
  when the ledger is used (vs "· rough estimate…" while a session estimate is still settling).
- **Inventory drawdown sparkline** on tea detail. A calm SVG: a jade spine from the purchase
  anchor (full pack) down to today's on-hand amount, a soft area fill, and a dashed amber
  projection to the estimated run-out date, with buy-date/amount and "runs out ~date" captions.
  Only renders when a real buy anchor exists (teas you already had have no chart). Info, not
  gamification — no toggle, shows in Quiet/Calm mode too. `inventoryHistory` + `inventorySparkline`
  live in steep-dashboard. First payoff of the v3.26 purchase-date enabler.
- Parked (noted in ROADMAP): a per-session drawdown *staircase* overlaid on the spine, and the
  same sparkline on the Home restock card — deferred to keep this a small deploy.

## v3.27 — update prompt + editable dashboard
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v38), `steep-boot.js`, `steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-core.js`.
- **"New version available" prompt.** The service worker no longer auto-`skipWaiting()`s; on an
  update it waits, and `steep-boot.js` shows a small bottom banner ("A new version of Steep is
  ready — Refresh"). Tapping it messages the waiting worker to activate, then reloads once on
  `controllerchange`. Also an hourly `reg.update()` so long-lived installed PWAs notice.
  This ends the "deployed but still on the old UI / hard-reload dance" problem — no session is
  interrupted mid-brew, and the user opts in to refresh.
- **Editable dashboard.** Home cards are now a named registry rendered from a saved order + a
  hidden set (`settings.dashLayout`, synced — no migration). An "✎ Edit layout" chip enters edit
  mode: each card gets ↑ / ↓ / Hide, plus a "Hidden cards" panel to restore, and "Reset to
  default order". Cards: persona, recap, Wrapped, running-low, recent, totals, brewing clock,
  insights, what-you-brewed, most-brewed/top-rated, favorites, cost. Unknown/new cards fall back
  to the default order (forward-compatible), so future cards appear automatically. `renderDashboard`
  + the layout helpers live in steep-dashboard; edit mode clears on navigation.

## v3.26 — monthly spend overview (+ purchase-date enabler)
DB: run `v3_5-purchase-date.sql` (adds a nullable `purchase_date` to `teas`).
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v37), `steep-data.js`, `steep-teas.js`, `steep-shopping.js`,
        `steep-core.js`, `steep-dashboard.js`.
- **Purchase date** on teas, distinct from date-added (created_at). The tea form gains a
  "Purchase date" field with a "Today" quick-set; leaving it blank means "stock I already had"
  so an initial backlog isn't counted as this month's spend. Teas added from the shopping list
  default to today. Shown on the tea detail. (Architecture enabler — also unblocks
  inventory-over-time and sharper restock timing.)
- **Spending view** (tap "Total spent" on the Home cost overview): current-month total, a
  12-month bar series (this month highlighted), avg per active month, tracked total, and the
  list of teas bought this month (tap through to the tea). Priced teas without a purchase date
  are excluded from the monthly view and summarised separately. Home cost overview also shows a
  quiet "This month: N across M teas" teaser. No new module; `computeMonthlySpend()` +
  `viewSpend()` live in steep-dashboard, `monthKey`/`monthLabel` in steep-core.

## v3.25 — brew advice
DB: run `v3_4-brew-advice.sql` (adds a nullable `feedback` column to `sessions`).
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v36), `steep-core.js`, `steep-sessions.js`, `steep-settings.js`,
        `steep-data.js`.
- Optional one-tap **"How was this cup?"** (Just right / A bit strong / A bit weak) on the
  wrap-up and quick-log screens. Stored per session; tap again to clear. Sessions stay loose —
  it's never required.
- `computeBrewAdvice()` (steep-core) turns a tea's recent sessions into a gentle tuning of its
  brew guide: each session's signal is the explicit pick, else inferred from tasting tags
  (bitter/astringent → strong, watery/thin → weak). Net signal → a small, capped temp/time
  nudge (±6° / ±24%) off the parsed baseline.
- Session setup now shows a **Guide / Your tuning / Off** selector (replaces the v3.24 on/off
  toggle) plus a memory line ("Logged 5× · 3 just right · 2 a bit strong — suggests cooler…").
  Picking "Your tuning" prefills the adjusted schedule; the steeping strip labels it. A
  **Save this tuning as the tea's brew guide** action writes it back to the brewGuide text and
  marks a "tuned as of now" timestamp (in synced settings) so saved tunings don't re-nudge.
- Skipped for cold brew. New synced setting **Brew advice** (default on). Only one small SQL
  migration; no new tea column, no new module.

## v3.24 — brew-guide → prefilled steep schedule
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v35), `steep-core.js`, `steep-sessions.js`, `steep-settings.js`,
        `steep-dashboard.js`.
- Parses each tea's free-text "How to brew" note into a light schedule
  (`{tempC, rinseSeconds, times[]}`) via `parseBrewGuide()` in steep-core. Rule-based and
  forgiving: gongfu slash-runs (`15s / 20s / 30s`), comma lists, `m:ss` clocks, Western
  minute steeps, °F→°C, "boiling"/"degrees"; strips grams/ml/years/infusion-counts so they
  aren't read as times; returns null when nothing usable is found (calm-first — no schedule,
  no fuss).
- Session setup shows a "From your brew guide" preview (temp · rinse · times) with a
  per-session toggle. During steeping, each infusion's timer target + temperature are
  prefilled; a quiet strip shows the plan with the current step marked and extrapolated
  steeps flagged `~` (extends past the listed steeps by repeating the last gap). Everything
  stays editable; "turn off" disables it mid-session.
- Skipped for cold brew (which already has its own single-long-steep path). New synced
  setting **Brew-guide autofill** (default on). No SQL, no CSS, no new module.
- Also in this batch: moved the **Data & account** section (export/import/move-photos/sign-out)
  off Home into the bottom of the Settings modal (reachable via ⚙, styled as a settings row).

## v3.23 — theme toggle in Settings only
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v34), `steep-core.js`.
- Removed the header ☀️/🌙 button; appearance lives in Settings.

## v3.22 — quick-fix batch
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v33), `steep-teas.js`, `steep-dashboard.js`,
        `steep-core.js`, `steep-settings.js`.
- Favourite-tea filter (★) in the Teas library.
- Light/Dark control in Settings (mirrors the header toggle).
- Steep Wrapped no longer counts cold-brew steep time toward "steeping time".
- Cost overview: tapping "Low stock" opens the Teas list filtered to low stock.
- Cost/session on a tea's detail (cost/gram × avg leaf per session).

## v3.21 — hotfix: shared sessions leaking into personal stats
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v32), `steep-data.js`.
- loadKey('sessions') / steeps now filter by user_id. A social RLS policy lets
  followers read shared sessions; the unfiltered personal query was pulling those
  into your own stats, streak, insights, persona, and Wrapped. Feed unaffected.

## v3.20 — shopping list
DB: run v3_3-wishlist.sql (new `wishlist` table + RLS).
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v31), `steep-shopping.js` (new), `steep-data.js`,
        `steep-core.js`, `steep-teas.js`, `index.html`.
- Shopping list behind a 🛒 header icon: manual entries + auto-suggested restocks
  from the forecast (low/out teas, favourites first), check-off, and "add as tea"
  (pre-fills the tea form). Wishlist writes flow through the offline queue.

## v3.19 — richer tea persona
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v30), `steep-dashboard.js`.
- Persona blends habit signals: a title modifier (Cold-Brew / Gongfu / Nocturnal
  / Morning) on the type core, plus up to two combined subtitle traits (cadence,
  time of day, infusion depth, leaf strength, loyalty vs variety, perfect cups).

## v3.18 — vendor manager → Teas tab
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v29), `steep-teas.js`, `steep-settings.js`.
- Moved vendor rename/merge out of Settings into an "Edit vendors" toggle beside
  "＋ Add tea" in the Teas tab, as an inline panel. Removed from Settings (pointer
  left behind). Same rename/merge logic; scales better as vendors grow.

## v3.17 — pixel font swap
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v28), `styles.css`, `index.html`.
- Replaced Silkscreen with Pixelify Sans for the pixel display font, so 4 and 9
  are clearly distinct. "Clean" font toggle unchanged.

## v3.16 — cleanup pass
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v27), `steep-sessions.js`, `steep-dashboard.js`.
- Cold-brew sessions skip the timed-steep flow — logged as a single long steep
  (no per-steep timer / infusion stepper).
- Streak heatmap starts at your first logged week (clamped 4–13 weeks) instead of
  a fixed 13, so a fresh log no longer shows a long empty run.

## v3.15 — Steep Wrapped
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v26), `steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-core.js`.
- Steep Wrapped: a seasonal recap view (Northern-hemisphere meteorological
  seasons) built from existing session data — sessions, infusions, grams,
  steeping time, top tea/type, favourite time, new teas, standout cup. Dashboard
  teaser card opens it; share via Web Share API with clipboard fallback (text).
- No new infra. (Bundles the v3.14 insights cadence fix in the same dashboard file.)

## v3.14 — insights cadence fix
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v25), `steep-dashboard.js`.
- Insights cadence now measures over the span you've actually been logging (not a
  flat 4 weeks), and phrases per-day once you're brewing daily+ ("about 2× a day
  lately"). A steady month-long 2×/week user still reads "2× a week."

## v3.13 — offline write queue
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v24), `steep-data.js`, `steep-sessions.js`.

- **Offline write queue (Option B).** Personal-data writes (teas, vessels,
  sessions, tags, settings) are now local-first: cached immediately and queued
  on network failure, replayed FIFO on reconnect / next write / launch.
  Idempotent (upsert/delete by id); FIFO keeps foreign refs valid. "N waiting
  to sync" pill + "Synced N" toast. Non-network errors still surface.
- Offline session photos are deferred — session saves now, photo re-added when
  online. Data: URLs are never persisted to Postgres.
- Social actions and bulk import remain online-only by design.
  
## v3.12 — insights
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v23), `steep-dashboard.js`.

- **Insights card** on Home (under the brewing clock). Reads session timestamps +
  grams for gentle, calm-first patterns: weekly cadence with a trend vs the prior
  28 days, weekend-vs-weekday lean, dominant time of day, steepiest weekday, and
  this-month-vs-last (sessions + grams). Signal-gated so rows only appear with
  enough data; the whole card hides below 5 sessions. No CSS/SQL — reuses the
  recap row + stat styles.

## v3.11 — vendor manager
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v22), `steep-teas.js`, `steep-settings.js`, `styles.css`.

- **Vendor manager** in Settings — lists every shop you've used with its tea count; rename
  to fix typos, or type an existing name to merge duplicates. Updates the `source` on every
  affected tea (per-row writes). No popups.

## v3.10 — consumption forecast, map matching fixes
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v21), `steep-passport.js`, `steep-dashboard.js`,
`steep-teas.js`, `styles.css`.

- **"Runs out in ~N days" forecast.** From each tea's grams-tracked sessions we estimate a
  weekly consumption rate and project when it'll run out. Shown on the tea detail ("~5g/week,
  about 2 weeks left") and appended to the Running-low card. Needs ≥2 grams-tracked sessions;
  flagged "rough estimate" until ≥4 — it genuinely sharpens as more sessions are logged.
- **Map matching fixes.** (1) Ordering bug: a Taiwan tea ("Ali Shan Fo Shou Dong Pian")
  matched China via "fo shou". Matching now trusts the origin field first, then picks the
  LONGEST/most-specific keyword, so "ali shan"/"dong pian" win. (2) Big keyword expansion for
  China (yunnan, huoshan/huang ya, wuyi, dancong, many regions), Japan and Taiwan.

## v3.9 — meditative focus mode
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v20), `steep-core.js`, `steep-sessions.js`, `styles.css`.

- **Focus mode** during a steeping session: a "🧘 Focus mode" button opens a calm,
  distraction-free screen (no topbar/tabs) with the tea name, a teacup that fills with amber
  as the steep progresses, a large countdown, and gentle steam. Minimal controls: Start/Pause,
  Reset, "Log this infusion →" (records the time and resets for the next), and exit. The
  character-in-a-tea-garden animation is deferred until there's human-made art; this is the
  mechanic + cup-fill timer.

## v3.8 — streak regression fix, map cleanup, gaiwan app icon
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v19), `steep-dashboard.js`, `steep-passport.js`,
`steep-teas.js`, and the new `icon-192.png` / `icon-512.png`.

- **Streak fix (regression).** The Monday-alignment shifted the grid start back without
  extending the end, so the last column ended a few days BEFORE today and recent squares
  (incl. today) fell off the grid — no green. Now the last column is anchored to the current
  week, so today is always shown.
- **World map cleanup.** Cropped to the tea hemisphere (Europe/Africa/Asia/Oceania) — the
  Americas are dropped, which zooms everything up so it's readable on mobile. Tapping a tea
  from the map now returns to the passport (back button says "Back to passport").
- **App icon.** New pixel-gaiwan `icon-192.png` / `icon-512.png` (jade bg). Replaces the old
  home-screen icon. On iOS/Android you may need to remove and re-add to the home screen to
  see it, since the OS caches the old icon.

## v3.7 — passport polish, running-low reminder, weigh-with-packaging
Deploy: `service-worker.js` (v18), `steep-passport.js`, `steep-core.js`,
`steep-settings.js`, `steep-teas.js`, `steep-dashboard.js`.

- **Passport cleanup.** Pins now render clay (were black — a CSS class wasn't applying),
  chips/teachips have proper spacing (styling inlined so it no longer depends on fresh CSS),
  map cropped of the empty far-south band. Matching now reads the tea NAME too (not just the
  origin field), so "Yunnan Silver Bud", "... Dancong", "Sencha Kagoshima" auto-place. Added
  aliases: dancong, guandong, ya bao, yashi xiang.
- **Running low** section on Home — favourited/would-rebuy teas under 2× the low-stock
  threshold, flagged "low" (red) / "getting low" (amber), tap to open.
- **Weigh with packaging** — tea form has a "weighed with packaging" checkbox + tare field
  (default from a new Settings value, 10g); net weight is stored so you needn't decant.

## v3.6 — streak date fix, world-map Tea Passport
Deploy: `index.html`, `service-worker.js` (v17), `styles.css`, `steep-core.js`,
`steep-dashboard.js`, and new `steep-passport.js`.

- **Streak fix.** All day-bucketing now uses local calendar dates instead of UTC, so
  late-evening sessions no longer land on the wrong day. Streak also no longer resets to
  0 just because today isn't logged yet (counts from yesterday). Heatmap is Monday-aligned
  with weekday labels + a caption.
- **Tea Passport** (`steep-passport.js`) — world dot-map reached from the 🌍 header button.
  Dots sized by teas owned per country; country-level matching from the `origin` field
  (country names + common regions/cultivars as keywords). Tap a pin/region → teas → tap a
  tea to open it. Unmapped-origin teas listed underneath. Sub-regions/cultivars later.

## v3.5 — modularization, header, logo, critical cache fix
Deploy: `index.html`, `service-worker.js` (v16), `styles.css`, and all `steep-*.js`
modules. **Delete `app.js` from the repo** — it's replaced by the modules.

- **Critical: service worker no longer caches Supabase data.** It was cache-first for
  everything, so added teas/photos only appeared after a hard reload. Now it caches
  only the app shell; all Supabase calls go straight to the network. Fixes the
  disappearing-data and stale-sync problems. (One hard reload after deploying v16.)
- Split `app.js` into 7 modules (above). Byte-identical behavior.
- Header redesigned: brand row (logo + 🏆 ⚙ 🌙) / tab row / full-width Log session.
- New 8-bit gaiwan logo (`steepLogoSVG()` in steep-core) — swap that one function to
  change the logo everywhere. Placeholder until human-made art.
- Dashboard → "Home". Adjustable low-stock threshold (default 15g, Settings).
  Teas tab shows owned / in-stock / low counts.

## v3.4 — streak → Sessions, weekly/monthly recap
Deploy: `app.js`, `styles.css`, `service-worker.js` (v14).
- Drinking-streak heatmap moved from dashboard to the Sessions tab (under the calendar).
- Recap card on Home with This week / This month toggle.

## v3.3 — heatmap polish
Deploy: `app.js`, `styles.css`, `service-worker.js` (v13).
- Compact heatmap; today's cell ringed; legend added.

## v3.2 — session photos
Deploy: `app.js`, `steep-data.js`, `styles.css`, `service-worker.js`. SQL: `v3_2-session-photos.sql`.
- Optional photo per session (wrap-up + quick log), shown in feed and tea detail.

## v3.1 — quick/gongfu log
Deploy: `app.js`, `steep-data.js`, `styles.css`, `service-worker.js`. SQL: `v3_1-quick-log.sql`.
- Quick log (infusion count instead of timed steeps). Quiet mode, achievements page.

## v3.0 — per-row data layer
Deploy: `app.js`, `steep-data.js`.
- Replaced whole-array blob writes with per-row insert/update/delete. Profile/follow
  reliability fixes.

---

## Known / next
- Streak counter vs heatmap likely has a UTC-vs-local date mismatch (fix + weekday labels).
- World-map Tea Passport (own page, globe icon in header) — accurate geography, dots by
  teas owned per region, tea-name click-through.
- Header cleanup follow-ups, favourites low-stock reminder, weight-with-packaging entry,
  vendor manager, predictive "runs out in ~N days".
- Backlog lives in ROADMAP-v3-next.md.
